Monitors rely critically on semaphores and condition variables.
Assignment 4 offers an opportunity for you to use the mutex locks and
condition variables as a synchronization mechanism in the context 
of a file copying operation through bounded-buffer producer-consumer
approach. Compared with the semaphore-based solution where the order 
of two semaphore wait operations is of pivotal importance to avoid
potential deadlocks, here when a thread has to suspend on a condition,
the pthread_cond_wait will automatically release the mutex lock,
thus circumventing potential deadlocks. Aside from that, much of 
the logic in your assignment 3 can be reused. This exercise illustrates
the point that there are different synchronization approaches to 
a given problem.
