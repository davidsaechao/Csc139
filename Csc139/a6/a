VIRTUAL MEMORY ALLOWS A DISK FILE TO BE MAPPED INTO MEMORY THROUGH THE
MMAP CALL, THUS MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR FILE I/O TO BE CARRIED OUT VIA
SIMPLE MEMORY ACCESSES. IN THIS ASSIGNMENT, THE PARENT PROCESS MEMORY-MAPS
THIS DISK FILE FIRST, AND THEN CREATES TWO CHILD PROCESSES THAT EACH MAKE
SOME UPDATES TO THE FILE. WHEN BOTH CHILD PROCESSES ARE DONE, UPDATES MADE
ARE SYNCHâ€™ED TO THE DISK FILE.
